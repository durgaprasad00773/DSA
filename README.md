# 📘 DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my daily practice of **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.  
All solutions are written primarily in **C++**, covering problems from platforms like **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, **AtCoder**, and **CSES**.

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Strengthen problem-solving skills  
- Master all important DSA patterns  
- Improve speed + logic for competitive programming  
- Maintain a clean record of progress
